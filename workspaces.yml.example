# Workspace configuration
#
# Per-project Procfile templates:
#   Create a Procfile.workspace.template in the project's path directory
#   to customize the Procfile for that project. Available variables:
#     $RAILS_PORT - the generated Rails server port
#     $VITE_PORT  - the generated Vite port
#   If no template exists, a default Rails/Sidekiq template is used.

projects:
  myproject:
    path: ~/projects/myproject/app      # Main checkout (source of .env, etc)
    worktree_dir: ~/projects/myproject  # Where worktrees go

  # Add more projects with same structure
  # another-project:
  #   path: ~/projects/another/web
  #   worktree_dir: ~/projects/another
